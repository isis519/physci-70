  ### Week 4

 This week's assignment had to do with one of my weaknesses: coding. The assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something. I decided to figure out how to make it light up with an LED and a button.
 It was really complicated for me because I would continue to set certain things up wrong, or program it incorrectly, but in the end, I was able to made it light up with a button like I wanted.
 This is the code for it.
 #define LED_PIN 8
#define BUTTON_PIN 7
byte lastButtonState = LOW;
byte ledState = LOW;
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);
}
void loop() {
  byte buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    lastButtonState = buttonState;
    if (buttonState == LOW) {
      ledState = (ledState == HIGH) ? LOW: HIGH;
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);
    }
  }
}

This is what it came out to.
