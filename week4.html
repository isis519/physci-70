  ### Week 4

 This week's assignment had to do with one of my weaknesses: coding. The assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something. I decided to figure out how to make it light up with an LED and a button.
 It was really complicated for me because I would continue to set certain things up wrong, or program it incorrectly, but in the end, I was able to made it light up with a button like I wanted.
 This is the code for it.
