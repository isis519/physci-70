  ### Week 2

  For week 2, I learned how to use Autodesk Fusion 360 and make designs that were laser cut into cardboard. The only stressful part about this assignment was that it took so long to download Fusion 360, but otherwise, it was kind of fun to see your designs come to life. You just have to be ready to put the time in.

  I decided to make a sphere, and I got the reference from this website, and this is what their design looked like.
