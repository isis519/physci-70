  ### Week 2

  For week 2, I learned how to use Autodesk Fusion 360 and make designs that were laser cut into cardboard. The only stressful part about this assignment was that it took so long to download Fusion 360, but otherwise, it was kind of fun to see your designs come to life. You just have to be ready to put the time in.

  I decided to make a sphere, and I got the reference from this website, and this is what their design looked like.

Although this design is made out of wood, I wanted to replicate it with cardboard. Considering I made the CAD for this 30 minutes before they were opening the lab for laser cutting, I'm proud of myself for being able to take control of the situation and work on something I enjoyed making. These are the CAD designs I made.

Accounting for the 0.6 mm kerf, I measured the cardboard I planned on counting from, and since it was 4.4 mm, I made the thickness of my pieces 3.8mm. This is a video of the laser cutting process.
