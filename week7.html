  ### Week 7

  For week 7, our assigment was to use an output device that we haven't used before, so I decided to do LED lights. Starting the assignment was very difficult because my soldering skills were put to the test and I was struggling. I had soldered so much that I had singed the end of the LED lights and had to cut off the tip to start over.
