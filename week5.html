  ### Week 5

  For week 5, our assignment was to 3D print something, so I decided to make a pill bottle. At first I made the design on Onshape because Fusion 360 wasn't working for me, but then after desgining it I realized it did it in inches and I needed to do it in milimeters. Once Fusion 360 started working again, I remade the model in milimeters.
