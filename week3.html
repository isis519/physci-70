  ### Week 3

 This assignment's objective was to create a kinetic sculpture with the motor that we were given in class. I was pretty excited for this assignment since we got to learn how to solder and I love machining. However, this project was very difficult for me because I didn't realize how technical it was to make.

I decided to make a kinetic sculpture that simulates a waterdrop falling into water. I got the instructions from this video.

These are the Pictures for all of the parts I had to CAD on Fusion 360.
