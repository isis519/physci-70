  ### Week 6

  For week 6, although I was absent for the lecture because of food poisoning, it didn't take long to learn how to make these devices. My first task was to use a sensor from the kit to measure a physical quantity with my microcontroller, so I decided to use sound, and to measure the sound of the taps I made based on how hard and soft I tapped the MEMS microphone.

  Here is the video of how the plot graph showing how the sound of my taps are affecting it.
