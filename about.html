  ### About Me

  Hi, my name is Isis Paez! I am from Philadelphia, PA, and I go to a magnet high school called Central High School. I'm currently in my school's FRC robotics team, specifically machining, which means I get to be around all of the heavy machinery. I love reading, listening to music, and being with my friends, boyfriend, and family. I really enjoy being able to take this course to further my skills in engineering and work on my weaknesses, like programming.
